# PassVault ‚Äì Web App & Browser Extension  

PassVault is a **secure password manager** that lets you safely store and retrieve passwords for websites and applications.  
All encryption happens **locally inside the browser extension**, so even if the database is leaked, attackers only see **encrypted data**.

### Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

This diagram shows how data moves through the system during a single round of authentication.

![Data Flow Diagram for Authentication](./diagrams/DFD.jpeg)

1.  *Challenge:* Alice sends a challenge $c$ to Bob.
2.  *Response:* Bob uses $c$ to find the correct hash $h_{n-c}$ in his pre-computed chain and sends it back.
3.  *Verification:* Alice computes $H(h_{n-c})$ and checks if it matches her stored value. If it does, the round is successful.
